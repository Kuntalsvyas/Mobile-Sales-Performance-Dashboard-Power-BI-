## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a comprehensive **Power BI Dashboard** designed to analyze and visualize mobile phone sales data. By transforming raw transactional records into an interactive visual report, I have provided a way for stakeholders to track sales trends, brand performance, and customer demographics in real-time.

The goal was to identify which mobile brands are driving revenue, how different payment methods are utilized, and which cities are the primary hubs for sales.

## 📊 Key Insights & KPIs
* **Revenue Analysis:** Tracking total sales value and units sold across different brands (Apple, Samsung, Vivo, Xiaomi, OnePlus).
* **Brand Performance:** Comparative analysis of brands based on customer ratings and total units sold.
* **Customer Demographics:** Visualizing sales distribution by **Customer Age** and **City** to identify target markets.
* **Payment Preferences:** Breakdowns of transactions via **UPI, Credit Card, Debit Card, and Cash** to understand consumer behavior.
* **Rating Trends:** Correlating **Customer Ratings** with specific mobile models to identify top-tier products.

## 🛠️ Technical Toolkit
* **Power BI Desktop:** Used for data modeling, DAX calculations, and dashboard design.
* **Data Cleaning (Power Query):** * Standardized "Day Name" and "Month" formats.
    * Handled inconsistent brand naming and formatted currency values.
    * Created calculated columns for total revenue (Units Sold * Price Per Unit).

## 💡 Business Value
This dashboard serves as a strategic tool for retail managers to:
1. **Optimize Inventory:** By seeing which models (e.g., iPhone 12, Galaxy S21, Redmi Note 10) have the highest turnover.
2. **Targeted Marketing:** By identifying that specific age groups or cities (like Delhi, Mumbai, or Ludhiana) are high-performing regions.
3. **Financial Planning:** By understanding the most popular payment methods to streamline checkout processes.
